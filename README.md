# Space-Invaders
Space Invaders by NexPetaurus. This is just space invaders but with my own made sprites. It runs a little slow but oh well I can't be bothered to fix it. This is becuase every frame it has to render the backround and its a big-ish file. So if u wanna make it faster see the README.txt file

---

To Make the code faster:
1. Open The Code In A Code Editor Such As SublimeText or PyCharm
2. Goto Lines 101 and 103
3. Put A Hastag (#) before both lines of code
4. Run The Program
